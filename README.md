# Python Implementation of Aho-Corasick Algorithm

## Overview

This project implements the **Aho-Corasick algorithm** in Python to efficiently search for multiple DNA patterns within a given genomic sequence. The Aho-Corasick algorithm is a powerful string-matching technique that constructs a **trie** (prefix tree) from a set of patterns and uses **failure links** to optimize the search process. This makes it particularly well-suited for bioinformatics applications, where identifying specific DNA sequences is crucial.

## Key Features

- **Trie Construction**: Builds a trie data structure to store all patterns efficiently.
- **Failure Links**: Implements failure links to handle mismatches during pattern matching, reducing redundant comparisons.
- **Pattern Matching**: Traverses the input sequence to find all occurrences of the patterns in a single pass.
- **Efficient Complexity**: The algorithm has a preprocessing complexity of **O(m)** (where `m` is the total length of all patterns) and a matching complexity of **O(n + z)** (where `n` is the sequence length and `z` is the number of matches).

## Applications

The Aho-Corasick algorithm has several real-world applications, including:

1. **Bioinformatics**: Identifying DNA/RNA sequence patterns, genetic markers, and motifs in genomic data.
2. **Intrusion Detection**: Scanning network traffic for known attack signatures in cybersecurity.
3. **Text Analysis**: Efficiently searching for multiple keywords or phrases in large text datasets for natural language processing tasks.

## Implementation Details

The project consists of the following components:

- **Trie Class**: Manages the trie structure and failure links.
- **Search Function**: Traverses the DNA sequence to find all pattern matches.
- **Test Script**: Runs correctness and runtime tests to validate the implementation.

## Correctness Testing

The implementation includes a comprehensive set of test cases to ensure the algorithm works correctly under various scenarios, including:

- Overlapping patterns
- Nested patterns
- Single-character patterns
- Sequences with no matches
- Special characters and reverse complement patterns

## Runtime Analysis

The runtime performance of the algorithm is analyzed using randomized DNA sequences and different pattern set sizes. The results show that the algorithm scales well with sequence length but experiences increased computational overhead with larger pattern sets.

## Performance Insights

- **Scaling with Sequence Length**: Runtime grows linearly with sequence length, consistent with the O(n + z) complexity.
- **Pattern Set Complexity**: Increasing the number of patterns leads to faster runtime growth, especially for longer sequences.
- **Efficiency**: The algorithm performs well for smaller pattern sets but faces practical limitations with large numbers of patterns in extensive sequences.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the practical implementation of the Aho-Corasick algorithm for DNA pattern matching. The algorithm's efficiency and correctness were validated through rigorous testing. Future work could involve extending the tool to handle noisy or incomplete DNA data and parallelizing the algorithm for larger datasets.
